            <h2>My Favorite DAW and Relative Comparisons</h2>

            <p>My favorite DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) is Ableton Live. I have over 8 years of experience 
                within the software and despite my obvious bias I have become familiar with many other DAW’s 
                over my many years of audio production. My close second to Ableton is Reaper due to it’s 
                customizability, industry standard workflow, and low cost and accessibility. Although Ableton 
                has some better midi editing and stock plugins (of which Reaper’s are still quite competitive) 
                Reaper’s similarities to the long standing industry standard Pro Tools mean it is incredibly 
                powerful, while avoiding some of the more dated practices of Pro Tools. I hate Pro Tools, as it 
                feels like an outdated Reaper, for about 10 - 15 times the money depending on the version you aquire. 
                Pro Tools tries to appeal to people who learned audio production on hardware and therefore makes 
                some very odd workflow decisions that Ableton and Reaper do not share as they more fully utilize 
                the platform of modern computing and software language. I also avoid recommending Audacity, because 
                while simple, it’s workflow differs greatly from all other daws, meaning your knowledge stays very 
                one dimensional while learning and isn’t nearly as powerful or useful as other easily acquirable and 
                operable DAW’s such as Reaper.</p>

            <h2>My Favorite Video Game of the Last 10 Years</h2>
            <p><img src="Images/OuterWilds.jpg" alt="Outer Wilds cover art"></p>

            <p>My Favorite Video Game I’ve played in a long while is Outer Wilds. Not to be confused with Outer 
                Worlds, which was released around the same time. Not that comparison is necessary but since the two 
                games are confused so often by their title it’s worth noting their differences. Outer Worlds was a 
                space RPG based around character progression, dialogue choices, ability based gunplay. Although very 
                exciting sounding, in practice this style of game has been around for years by the time Outer Worlds 
                was released despite much hype surrounding the game, it all felt stale. Outer Wilds in contrast took a 
                mechanic that, while found in many classic games, is too often overshadowed by other industry 
                buzzwords and standards and that mechanic is discovery. There are no upgrades, quest marks, or even 
                voiced dialogue in Outer Wilds. What Outer Wilds does possess, is giving the feeling of exploration 
                and discovery in a streamlined package that blockbuster open world rpgs often promise, but miss the 
                mark on due to bloat and emphasis on character progression. The organic progression of Outer Wilds 
                is unlike any game I’ve played in recent years and gives an unforgettable experience that one can 
                only hope can be captured again in future games.</p>
