            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><img src="Images/Me.JPG" alt="Image of myself" id="this-is-me"></p>
            <p>Hi, I’m Austin and I’ll be graduating from MSU this December. I am a media information major with a focus in 
                game development. I specialize in video game audio, sfx, implementation, and composing. You may have seen me 
                in the MSU GEL lab before the pandemic or as LA to Dr. Thompson’s Intro to Wwise course.
            </p>
            <p>My hobbies include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Producing music</li>
                <li>Playing video games</li>
                <li>Playing rec soccer</li>
                <li>Watching Youtube</li>
                <li>Long walks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I make a lot of music in my free time and upload semi regularly to SoundCloud, yep bonafide SoundCloud rapper 
                at this point, help. I play games daily, mainly Rocket League and Valorant, and that has been my main form 
                of socialization during the pandemic. When restrictions allow I play rec soccer, I used to play defense on 
                the varsity team in high school, now I play just for fun. I watch a lot of youtube and it’s my main form of 
                media consumption and learning outside of school. I’m trying to go outside more so I occasionally go for 
                long walks, I heard it’s good for my health.
